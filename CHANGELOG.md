# Changelog

All notable changes to BA-Kit Antigravity.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-13 — Gstack Distillation (Marketing v3.4.0)

### Added
- **10 new agents** distilled from `garrytan/gstack` analysis:
  - `@ba-as-built` — spec drift detector (reads git diff, finds where code diverged from BRD/SRS/RTM)
  - `@ba-autoreview` — strict-sequential meta: consistency → quality-gate → traceability → auditor, optional `--dual-voice`
  - `@ba-retro` — time-windowed sprint retro (churn, gate rejection trends, cycle time, per-author leaderboard)
  - `@ba-learn` — per-project JSONL emergent memory (5 types, PII filter, auto-capture API)
  - `@ba-checkpoint` — session save/resume for long-running BA work
  - `@ba-challenger` — 5-vector adversarial red team (unstated / incentive / adversarial / scale-break / sunset)
  - `@ba-second-opinion` — cross-model independent review (Gemini / OpenAI / Ollama / manual, zero-dep `urllib`)
  - `@ba-baseline` — sha256-locked CCB baselines with append-only history + supersede semantics
  - `@ba-guard` — pre-flight change-control checker (off / warn / strict + optional git hook)
  - `@ba-shotgun` — N-variant generator for stories / AC / priority / emails (preference capture)
- **5 Python helpers** (zero external deps, stdlib only): `ba_as_built.py`, `ba_retro.py`, `ba_learn.py`, `ba_baseline.py`, `ba_second_opinion.py`
- **`setup.sh`** one-liner install with auto-host detection (antigravity / claude-code / cowork)
- **`docs/sprint-spine.md`** — unified 7-phase loop (Discover→Elicit→Define→Validate→Prioritize→Publish→Reflect)
- **`AGENTS.md` §7** — second-opinion provider auto-detection table (priority order: GEMINI > OPENAI > OLLAMA > manual)
- **`AGENTS.md` §8** — strict CCB workflow (3-step opt-in for regulated teams)

### Changed
- Agent count **33 → 43** across README, README.vi, agent-cheat-sheet, junior-start, antigravity-protocol, ai-foundation, usage-guide, _shared/system-prompt, ba-master, architecture-decisions
- README badges bumped: `Version-3.1.0 → 3.2.0`, `Agents-33 → 43`, logo cache-bust v3.1.0 → v3.2.0
- `ba-master/SKILL.md` Decision Matrix: +20 routing entries for 10 new skills, +Sprint Spine Agents registry section
- `ba-shotgun/SKILL.md` — added rationale block explaining N=3 default + "vary constraint axis instead of inflating count"

### Fixed
- **YAML frontmatter**: 23 SKILL.md files had unquoted `description: [Agentic] foo` causing strict parser failures. All quoted (`"[...]"`) — 45/45 now parse cleanly.
- `docs/sprint-spine.md` self-correction: "v3.1 has 33 agents" → "v3.1 had 33, v3.2 has 43"
- `docs/architecture-decisions.md` Production Readiness Score: agent count breakdown updated
- **BA-fit reframing** (4 v3.4 skills bumped 1.0.0 → 1.1.0): catch where gstack-imported mechanisms leaked engineer vocabulary into BA-facing skills.
  - `ba-as-built` — primary mode now reads delivered evidence pack (UAT reports, release notes, demo notes); git mode demoted to opt-in advanced for hybrid BA+dev teams
  - `ba-retro` — primary input now BA-Kit JSONL metric streams + file mtime; git log demoted to tertiary opt-in; output reframed from "commits/authors/sessions" to "gate pass rate / churn / stakeholder responsiveness"
  - `ba-baseline` — agent now uses natural-language conversation ("which doc / version / signer / rationale"); sha256 hidden entirely from BA output; integrity check runs silently
  - `ba-guard` — 3 modes (off / warn / strict) described in BA language; alerts say "BRD-HR was edited 2 days after sign-off — was this re-approved?" instead of "DRIFT detected: hash mismatch"; git pre-commit hook stays as opt-in advanced
  - Python helpers UNCHANGED (mechanism layer is correct for both modes; only SKILL.md presentation reframed)
- **BA-fit Phase 2** — spot-check 5 v3.1 skills + 2 wrappers + 2 connectors:
  - `ba-jira` + `ba-confluence` Prerequisites sections reframed: "one-time IT setup, not your daily job" with clear separation between IT setup and BA daily workflow
  - `jira-connector` + `confluence-connector` infrastructure header added: "loaded by ba-jira / ba-confluence, not for direct BA invocation"
  - 3 spot-checked v3.1 skills clean (ba-test-gen, ba-data, ba-process)
- **BA-fit Phase 3** — spot-check 5 more v3.1 skills + ship `@ba-setup`:
  - `ba-metrics` "Fix the build" engineer slang → "Fix the requirements process" (BA language)
  - 4 v3.1 skills clean (ba-solution, ba-innovation, ba-systems, ba-strategy)
  - **NEW skill `@ba-setup`** (44 agents total): one-time setup wizard with BA-friendly natural-language flow for Jira / Confluence / second-opinion provider configuration
  - **NEW helper `ba_setup.py`** (zero-dep stdlib): credential validation, atomic .env write (chmod 0600), placeholder rejection, masked token display, connectivity test via urllib
  - Closes the last identified BA-fit gap — BA never types `.env` files or CLI flags
- Cumulative: **15/46 skills spot-checked (33%)**, 0 hard issues, 4 minor surface edits applied. Confidence HIGH that remaining 31 are BA-appropriate.
