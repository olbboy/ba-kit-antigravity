# 🚀 Release 2.5.0: The Antigravity Squad Protocol

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Codename:** "The Specialist Squad"

We have evolved. No longer a "Swarm" of bots, we are now a **Cognitive Squad** of 15 Specialists.
This release brings **Military-Grade Professionalism** and **High-Assurance Capabilities** to your workflow.

## 🌟 What's New?

### 1. ⚔️ The "Squad" Terminology Pivot
We have deprecated the biological "Swarm" metaphor in favor of the professional **"Squad" (Biệt Đội)** concept.
*   **Old**: Insects, Instincts, Swarm Intelligence.
*   **New**: Specialists, Collaboration, Mission Control.
*   **Why**: To align with our **System 2** (Critical Thinking) architecture. We don't just buzz; we think.

### 2. 📒 The Continuity Ledger (Shared Memory)
The Squad now shares a "Working Brain" via `templates/CONTINUITY.md`.
*   **Context Injection**: Define your Goal & Constraints once.
*   **Squad Synchronization**: All 15 agents read this file before acting.
*   **Result**: Zero repetition. Maximum alignment.

### 3. 🛡️ "Level 5 Enabler" Maturity
We have refined our claim from "Level 5 Organization" to **"High-Assurance Enabler"**.
*   We provide the **Tools** (SPC, Root Cause, Python).
*   You provide the **Agency**.
*   Together, we achieve **CMMI Level 5 behaviors**.

## 🚀 Release 2.4.0: The Antigravity Native Update

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Codename:** "System 2 Swarm"

We are proud to announce the biggest architectural shift in the history of BA-Kit.
We have moved beyond "Python Scripts" to a true **Cognitive Swarm** powered by the **Antigravity Native Protocol (ANP)**.

## 🌟 What's New?

### 1. 🧠 System 2 Intelligence (The Reflective Loop)
Agents no longer just "output text". They now follow a strict cognitive process:
*   **System 1**: Draft the answer.
*   **System 2**: "Stop & Think" - Critique the draft for errors, hallucinations, or vague logic.
*   **Output**: The verified result.

### 2. 🛡️ Tool Mandates (Hardened Reliability)
We have eliminated common LLM errors by forcing agents to use tools:
*   **Math**: `@ba-solution` and `@ba-metrics` MUST use Python. No more mental math errors.
*   **Traceability**: `@ba-traceability` MUST use `grep` to verify links. No more hallucinated dependencies.
*   **Standards**: `@ba-nfr` MUST use `search_web` to verify ISO/GDPR clauses.

### 3. 🤖 The Full 15-Agent Roster
We have unlocked the "Level 5" capabilities with 3 new agents:
*   **`@ba-metrics`**: Statistical Process Control (SPC) expert.
*   **`@ba-root-cause`**: Deep investigator (5 Whys).
*   **`@ba-innovation`**: R&D scientist (A/B Testing).

### 4. 📖 The Workflow Cookbook
A new guide `WORKFLOW-COOKBOOK.md` containing **10 Battle-Tested Scenarios** (Startup, Enterprise, Crisis, etc.) to help you chain agents together for complex problem solving.
