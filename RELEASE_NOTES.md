## 🌟 Executive Summary
**BA-Kit v2.2.0** marks the completion of our visual identity overhaul and repository optimization. With a **new "World-Class" transparent logo** (The Knowledge Block) and refined documentation structure, the kit effectively communicates its **BABOK v3 Certified** status.

We also introduced **Context-Aware Best Practices**, empowering AI Agents to navigate project-specific templates intelligently.

## 🎨 Visual Identity Upgrade
- **New Logo**: A minimalist, architectural "B" block in Midnight Blue & Metallic Gold.
- **Improved Compatibility**: Fully transparent background for seamless integration in Dark/Light themes.
- **Coverage**: Applied across all documentation headers and assets.

## 🧹 Repository Hygiene
- **Cleanup**: Eliminated broken links and deprecated file references (old `00-MASTER-INDEX.md`).
- **Standardization**: Unified `README` and `QUICK-START` structures.

## 🚀 Upgrade Guidance
No breaking changes. Users can verify the new branding by checking the header of any `README` or `USAGE-GUIDE`.

For AI Agent integration:
- Review the new **"Context-Aware Template Organization"** section in `USAGE-GUIDE.vi.md` to optimize your project folders.
