A massive new bilingual (English-Vietnamese) guide that teaches BA-Kit through a real-world **Attendance System** project:

| Level | Experience | Focus | Output |
|-------|------------|-------|--------|
| 🟢 **Beginner** | 1-2 years | Doing the work right | User Stories, Use Cases |
| 🟡 **Intermediate** | 3-5 years | Doing the right work | NFRs, Data Models, Prioritization |
