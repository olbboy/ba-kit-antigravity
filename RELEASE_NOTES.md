## 🆕 What's New

### 1. Advanced Skills (CMMI Level 5)

Three new flagship skills enable continuous process optimization:

#### SKILL-18: Requirements Metrics & SPC
*Statistical Process Control for Requirements Engineering*

- 📈 **KPI Dashboard**: Quality, Process, and Productivity metrics
- 📊 **Control Charts**: UCL/LCL with Nelson Rules for anomaly detection
- 🎯 **Process Capability (Cpk)**: Target ≥ 1.33 for mature processes
- 🔄 **PDCA Cycle**: Plan-Do-Check-Act for continuous improvement

#### SKILL-19: Root Cause Analysis (CAR)
*Systematic elimination of defect sources*

- 🐟 **Fishbone Diagrams**: 6M analysis (Man, Method, Machine, Material, Measurement, Mother Nature)
- ❓ **5 Whys Template**: Drill down to systemic root causes
- 📊 **Pareto Analysis**: Focus on top 20% of issues causing 80% of problems
- 🧪 **Statistical Validation**: Hypothesis testing (T-Test, ANOVA)

#### SKILL-20: Innovation & Improvement (OID)
*Framework for controlled organizational change*

- 💡 **Innovation Pipeline**: Ideate → Evaluate → Pilot → Deploy
- 🧪 **Pilot Framework**: A/B testing for process changes
- 💰 **ROI Calculator**: Quantify improvement value
- 📢 **ADKAR Model**: Change management for rollout
