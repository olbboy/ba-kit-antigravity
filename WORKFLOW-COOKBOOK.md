1.  **`@ba-elicitation`**: "I have an idea for 'Uber for Dog Walkers'. Interview me to find the features."
    *   *(Agent uses Funnel Questioning to define User Personas and Core Loop)*
2.  **`@ba-writing`**: "Based on that interview, draft the MVP Feature List."
3.  **`@ba-prioritization`**: "Apply MoSCoW mapping to these features. We only have budget for 3 months."

    *   *(Agent uses Grep to verify links)*
2.  **`@ba-validation`**: "Identify any Requirement that DOES NOT have a linked Test Case."
3.  **`@ba-export`**: "Export this Matrix to a formal DOCX using the 'Bank Template'."
