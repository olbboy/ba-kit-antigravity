## 1. The "ba-" Prefix Decision

### Analysis

| Factor | Keep `ba-` | Remove `ba-` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Namespace Collision** | Safe. `@ba-master` is unique. | Risk. `@master` may conflict with other kits. |
| **Brand Identity** | Clear. "BA" = Business Analysis. | Generic. "Writing" could be any agent. |
| **Discoverability** | All agents sort together alphabetically. | Agents scatter across the list. |
| **Mental Model** | User knows all `@ba-*` = This Kit. | User must memorize arbitrary names. |
| **Migration Cost** | Zero. Status quo. | High. Update all files, docs, guides. |

### Decision: **Keep the `ba-` prefix**

The prefix acts as a namespace (like `@org/package` in npm). The 3-char overhead is negligible compared to clarity benefits.

If a pivot is needed in the future, `@req-*` (Requirements) is the preferred alternative.

## 2. Identity: "Swarm" → "Squad"

### Problem

| Language | "Swarm" Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **English** | Collective intelligence, synchronized movement |
| **Vietnamese** | "Bầy đàn" = instinct, insects, chaos, herd mentality (negative) |

This conflicts with BA-Kit's core value: **System 2 thinking** (deliberate, critical). "Bầy đàn" implies System 1 (reactive, instinctive).

### Decision: Use "Squad" (Biệt Đội)

| Concept | Old Term (Vi) | New Term (Vi) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Name** | Bầy Đàn (Swarm) | **Biệt Đội (Squad)** |
| **The Agents** | Con bot / Cá thể | **Chuyên Gia (Specialist)** |
| **Orchestrator** | Con đầu đàn | **Chỉ Huy (Commander)** |
| **Interaction** | Handoffs | **Phối Hợp (Collaboration)** |
| **Memory** | Sổ cái | **Hồ Sơ Dự Án (Project Dossier)** |

## 3. CMMI Level 5 Positioning

### The Dilemma

- **CMMI Level 5 ("Optimizing")** implies an *organization* that continuously changes its processes based on statistical data.
- **BA-Kit** provides the *tools* to do this (SPC Charts, Root Cause Analysis), but cannot force organizational change.
- Claiming "We are CMMI Level 5" risks sounding like marketing to seasoned Enterprise Architects.

### The "Exoskeleton" Theory

BA-Kit wraps around a human user and mechanically guides them to perform Level 5 behaviors:

| Level | Characteristic | Without BA-Kit | With BA-Kit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Initial** | Chaotic, hero-based | User guesses requirements | Agents force structure |
| **2. Managed** | Planned, tracked | User makes a checklist | `@ba-master` enforces routing |
| **3. Defined** | Standard processes | User reads a PDF guide | `.agent/skills` *are* the process |
| **4. Quantitative** | Statistical control | User needs a spreadsheet | `@ba-metrics` & `@ba-solution` do the math |
| **5. Optimizing** | Continuous improvement | User holds a retrospective | `@ba-root-cause`, `@ba-innovation`, `@ba-auditor`, `@ba-quality-gate` |

### The Gap

A true Level 5 system involves **recursive self-optimization** — agents rewriting their own skill files based on defect patterns. BA-Kit does not allow this (safety guardrail). The user must choose to improve.

### Decision: Use "CMMI Level 5 Enabler"

- ❌ "We are a CMMI Level 5 System" — implies the AI is the organization
- ✅ "We are a CMMI Level 5 Enabler" — the AI empowers the user

**Maturity Score**: 4.8 / 5.0 — The final 0.2 gap is human agency.

## 4. v3.1 Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: @ba-questioning as Separate Agent from @ba-elicitation

| Factor | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | `@ba-elicitation` conflated two modes: stakeholder interviews (open-ended exploration) and structured requirement questioning (gap-filling, clarification). |
| **Decision** | Split into two agents. `@ba-elicitation` = Journalist mode — funnel questioning, discovery, "Colombo" technique. `@ba-questioning` = Analyst mode — targeted gap analysis, structured probing, ambiguity resolution. |
| **Rationale** | Single Responsibility Principle. A BA in interview mode thinks differently than a BA in review mode. Separate agents = sharper, more consistent outputs. |
| **Trade-off** | +1 agent to remember. Mitigated by `@ba-master` routing automatically. |

### ADR-002: @ba-diagram as Centralized Diagram Agent

| Factor | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | Multiple agents (writing, process, traceability) each partially generated diagrams — inconsistent Mermaid syntax, mixed styles, no standard. |
| **Decision** | Centralize all diagram generation into `@ba-diagram`. Other agents describe WHAT diagram is needed; `@ba-diagram` generates the Mermaid/BPMN artifact. |
| **Rationale** | DRY principle. One agent owns diagram syntax knowledge, versioning, and Mermaid v11 compliance. Eliminates syntax drift across 44 agents. |
| **Mandatory Tool** | `@ba-diagram` MUST use Mermaid syntax (not ASCII) for all flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERDs, and BPMNs. |

### ADR-003: outputs/ Excluded from Git (with mini-app showcase exception)

| Factor | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | Generated artifacts (BRDs, SRS, specs) were being committed, causing bloat and false "code changes" in PRs. |
| **Decision** | `outputs/*` is listed in `.gitignore`. All generated documents live outside version control — **except** `outputs/mini-app-cham-cong/**` which is force-tracked via negation pattern as the canonical BA showcase reference. |
| **Rationale** | Generated output is ephemeral. Source of truth = agent skills + knowledge base + templates. Regenerate on demand. Keeps git history clean (structural changes only). The mini-app-cham-cong exception exists because it's not a per-project deliverable — it's a curated dogfooding reference shipped with the kit (12 modules, 53 US files, EAMS v2.1, RTM). |
| **Exception** | Templates in `.agent/templates/` ARE committed — they are source, not output. Mini-app-cham-cong showcase in `outputs/mini-app-cham-cong/` IS committed — reference material, not output. |

## 5. Production Readiness Score

| Category | Score | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | 10/10 | System 2, Tool Mandates, Anti-Rationalization guardrails, 44 Agents (21 core + 4 quality/audit + 7 lifecycle + ba-wiki + 11 sprint spine v3.4) |
| **Documentation** | 9/10 | Comprehensive with bilingual support |
| **Terminology** | 10/10 | "Squad" is professional and consistent |
| **Extensibility** | 8/10 | MCP integration, skill-based architecture |
| **Localization** | 8/10 | Vietnamese guides and bilingual docs |

| **Quality Assurance** | 9/10 | Quality Gate pipeline, Coverage Checker, BRD Scorecard |

**Overall**: **9.4 / 10** — Production ready with v3.0 quality pipeline.
